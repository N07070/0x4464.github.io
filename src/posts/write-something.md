# Write something

2018.04.05

I was listening to a [playlist on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX6ziVCJnEm59) the other day, and [Bees by The Ballroom Thieves](https://open.spotify.com/track/21vNMGKtXBA2a8PaVdIgrM) came on. This song contains a quote from Benjamin Franklin, which resonated with me: 

> Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.

I've considered setting up a blog many times, but have never pulled the trigger. Maybe I just felt I didn't have anything worthwhile to write. Maybe the daunting task of creating a design got in the way. Maybe I was afraid of what others would think about what I wrote, or maybe that nobody would read it.

None of these are good reasons not to write. While I don't have much experience writing, it is something I am interested in.

The above quote inspired me to get this blog set up. I may not be able to do much worth writing about, but I can write something worth reading, or at least I will try.

I will be using this blog to write about security and bug bounty related topics.
