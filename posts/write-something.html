<p>2018.04.05</p>
<p>I was listening to a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX6ziVCJnEm59">playlist on Spotify</a> the other day, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/21vNMGKtXBA2a8PaVdIgrM">Bees by The Ballroom Thieves</a> came on. This song contains a quote from Benjamin Franklin, which resonated with me: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve considered setting up a blog many times, but have never pulled the trigger. Maybe I just felt I didn&#39;t have anything worthwhile to write. Maybe the daunting task of creating a design got in the way. Maybe I was afraid of what others would think about what I wrote, or maybe that nobody would read it.</p>
<p>None of these are good reasons not to write. While I don&#39;t have much experience writing, it is something I am interested in.</p>
<p>The above quote inspired me to get this blog set up. I may not be able to do much worth writing about, but I can write something worth reading, or at least I will try.</p>
<p>I will be using this blog to write about security and bug bounty related topics.</p>
